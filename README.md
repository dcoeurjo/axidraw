Image stippling to SVG
===

This code creates stippling effects using [low discrepancy blue noise](https://github.com/dcoeurjo/LowDiscBlueNoise). The output is a valid SVG file you
can plot using an axis plotter for instance.

Check the command line options for more details.

The original idea comes from [Paul Rickards](https://shop.paulrickards.com) artwork.
